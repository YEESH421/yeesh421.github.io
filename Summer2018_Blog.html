  <h1>Summer 2018</h1>
    <img src = "RoofPool.JPG" alt = "Pool On Roof">
    <p>As summer comes to a close, it's time to reflect on how I spent my time.</p>
    <h3>May</h3>
    <img src = "fish.JPG" alt = "Fish" style = "width:300px; height: auto; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px" align = "left">
    <p> May started out with me getting my first full time job ever. I worked at a pizza place on a tiny island that my girlfriend happens to live on. I lived in a dorm by myself, which was nice, but the internet was pretty bad pretty much anywhere on the island. On top of that, my girlfriend was in Eruope vacationing, so there wasn't much for me to do in my freetime - which I didn't have a surplus of anyways since I was spending 6 days a week at work. When I did find some spare time, I went fishing. I had actually forgotten my fishing pole at home, so my first day attempting to fish, I tried making a pole out of a stick, some string I found on the beach, and a broken soda can tab. Luckily, I ran into a charitable old man who was willing to trade my trash pole for a real one. I caught this fish with the pole he gave me, but as it turns out, the fish was a smallmouth bass and it was illegal to fish them, as it was spawning season. I promptly released the fish but I was nevertheless proud to have caught my first fish in many years. </p>

    <h3>June</h3>

    <img src = "fashion.PNG" alt = "shopping with my gf" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
    <p>I was still working full time in June, and at this point, I was starting to collect a substantial amount of money. My Girlfriend was back from Europe and we got to spend some time at the pool and go to the mall for some windowshopping. Other than that though, I was still working long hours, and June was pretty much more of the same.</p>

    <h3>July</h3>
    <img src = "KayakDate.jpg" alt = "kayak date" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
      <img src = "PC1.JPG" alt = "Pc pic 1" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
        <img src = "PC2.JPG" alt = "PC pic 2" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
    <p>Starting in July, I started working only on the weekends, opening up more free time for me. I got to move back home for the weekdays and spend more time with my highschool friends. On the weekends, I'd sometimes go on little adventures on the island, like looking at cool houses and looking for caves while kayaking with my girlfriend. I also built my second PC ever in July. More than double the price of my previous $500 PC, my new one has a GTX 1070ti GPU, a Ryzen 2600x chip, 16 gigs of ddr4 ram, one terabyte of HDD storage and finally a 120 gb SSD storage which I have Windows and a few games on. I know there isn't any lighting in it right now, but my PC is positioned in a place where I can't usually see the window anyways, so getting lights isn't really worth it at the moment. </p>

    <h3>August</h3>
    <img src = "Wisconsin.JPG" alt = "Wisconsin" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
    <img src = "Code.JPG" alt = "Me Coding" style = "width:300px; height: auto;">
    <p>August rolled around and my summer was already almost over! I quit my summer job the second week of August to prepare for college and enjoy my last few days. I made a trip to Madison, Wisconsin to visit my friend going to college there. Madison is a great looking city with older styled architecture, but still looked very well maintained and was very clean. I hung out with some of my friend's friends, one of whom lived in a very luxurious apartment with hot tubs in every apartment room and a pool on the roof (it's the picture at the top of the post). I had a great time, and I'm glad I took the time to make the trip. My summer wasn't all play though, I started working on this website this month, researching places to host it, figuring out the styling, and even making a login page (which unfortunately is not working since Github doesn't support PHP). </p>
    <p>Overall, it was a pretty good summer. I made some money, went on a few adventures, and saw some friends I usually don't see during the school year. Hope summer 2019 is even better.</p>
