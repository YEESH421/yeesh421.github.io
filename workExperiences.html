        <p><h2>IBM</h2> I spent the summer of 2019 interning at IBM. I worked on an internal web app and learned new technologies
        such as Node.js, Vert.x (a Java framework), and a bit of Angular. I became accustomed to both working in an agile
        environment and using a production pipeline. In my opinion, the greatest thing I took away from the internship was knowing
        when (and when not to) ask questions and being able to learn new technologies quickly.</br>

        Aside from my technical experiences, I loved spending my with the other interns and learning from all my mentors. 
        Despite being a litte shy at times, I found no problem reaching out for help when I needed it, and I even formed close
        relationships with my mentors and fellow interns. I genuinely enjoyed every day of the internship, and I am grateful to have had an experience that was both challenging
        and fun.</p>

        new content, and creating/styling new pages that were to be added.</p>
